# Linked Lists

## 1. Overview
A **linked list** is a linear data structure where elements (nodes) are not stored contiguously in memory. Each node contains data and a reference (link) to the next node (and possibly the previous node). Linked lists allow efficient insertion and deletion but have O(n) access time.

In interviews, linked lists test your understanding of pointers/references, edge cases, and manipulation of node links. They are a favourite topic because they require careful handling of null references and can be solved elegantly with two-pointer techniques.

## 2. Types of Linked Lists

- **Singly Linked List** – Each node points to the next node only.  
  `Node(data, next)`
- **Doubly Linked List** – Each node has pointers to both next and previous nodes.  
  `Node(data, next, prev)`
- **Circular Linked List** – The last node points back to the first (or any other node), forming a loop. Can be singly or doubly linked.

## 3. Basic Operations

### Node Definition (Python)
```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
```

### Insertion
- **At beginning**: new node points to current head, update head.
- **At end**: traverse to last node, point its next to new node.
- **At given position**: traverse to position-1, adjust links.
- **After a given node**: new node points to node.next, node points to new node.

### Deletion
- **From beginning**: move head to head.next.
- **From end**: traverse to second last node, set its next to None.
- **By value**: keep prev pointer while traversing; when found, set prev.next = curr.next.

### Traversal
```python
def traverse(head):
    curr = head
    while curr:
        print(curr.val)
        curr = curr.next
```

## 4. Important Techniques and Patterns

### 🔹 Dummy (Sentinel) Node
- A temporary node placed before the head to simplify edge cases (e.g., when head itself may be deleted or modified).
- Use `dummy = ListNode(0); dummy.next = head`.

### 🔹 Two Pointers (Slow & Fast)
- **Fast moves 2 steps, slow moves 1 step**. Used for:
  - Finding middle node (when fast reaches end, slow is middle).
  - Detecting cycles (if fast meets slow, cycle exists).
  - Finding k-th node from end (fast moves k steps ahead, then both move together).

### 🔹 Reversing a Linked List
- **Iterative**: maintain prev, curr, nextTemp.
- **Recursive**: reverse rest, then adjust.

### 🔹 Merging Lists
- Use a dummy node to build the result.
- Compare heads of two sorted lists, attach smaller one, advance.

### 🔹 Cycle Detection (Floyd’s Algorithm)
- Detect cycle: slow and fast meet.
- Find cycle start: after meeting, reset slow to head; move both one step; meeting point is cycle start.

### 🔹 Palindrome Check
- Find middle (slow/fast), reverse second half, compare with first half.

### 🔹 Intersection Point of Two Lists
- Calculate lengths; align starts; move together until they meet (or null).

## 6. Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

| Pitfall                                   | Solution                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Dereferencing null (None) pointer**     | Always check `if node:` before accessing `node.next` or `node.val`.     |
| **Losing reference to head**               | Use a temporary variable when modifying links. Keep a `dummy` if needed. |
| **Infinite loops in cycle problems**       | Ensure fast moves two steps and slow one; stop when fast reaches end.    |
| **Not handling empty list or single node** | Write code that gracefully handles `head is None` or `head.next is None`. |
| **Forgetting to update tail in doubly list**| Always update both `next` and `prev` pointers.                           |
| **Off-by-one in position-based operations**| Draw diagrams to visualise links before coding.                          |

## 8. Interview Tips

- **Draw diagrams** – Before writing code, sketch the list and the link changes.
- **Clarify assumptions** – Singly or doubly? Can we modify the list? Should we return new head?
- **Edge cases first** – Empty list, single node, two nodes, cycle present.
- **Use dummy nodes** – They simplify insertion/deletion at head.
- **Test with examples** – Run through small cases mentally.
- **Name pointers meaningfully** – `prev`, `curr`, `next`, `slow`, `fast`.
- **Be comfortable with recursion** – Some problems (reverse, merge) have elegant recursive solutions.
