Perfect. This is the right mindset for interview prep.

You already know **basic Linked List operations**, so we are NOT going to waste time on trivial insert/delete.

We will optimize for:

* Pattern recognition
* Interview frequency
* Coverage > volume
* FAANG-level thinking
* Max 12 problems

---

# 🔗 LINKED LIST – OPTIMAL LEETCODE SEQUENCE

---

# ✅ Phase 1 — Core Pattern Builders (MUST DO)

These build 90% of interview recognition.

---

### 1️⃣ 206. Reverse Linked List

Pattern: **Pointer reversal**

Why important:

* Most fundamental linked list manipulation
* Tests pointer control
* Base for many other problems

You must:

* Do iterative
* Understand recursive (even if not perfect)

---

### 2️⃣ 141. Linked List Cycle

Pattern: **Fast & Slow Pointer (Floyd)**

Why important:

* First exposure to cycle detection
* Classic interviewer favorite
* Builds two-pointer mental model in linked list

---

### 3️⃣ 142. Linked List Cycle II

Pattern: **Cycle entrance detection**

Why important:

* Mathematical reasoning
* Tests deeper understanding of Floyd’s algorithm
* FAANG favorite

If you understand why fast = 2x slow → you’re good.

---

### 4️⃣ 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

Pattern: **Two pointer merge**

Why important:

* Same idea used in Merge Sort
* Foundational for harder problems
* Easy but very important

---

### 5️⃣ 19. Remove Nth Node From End

Pattern: **Two pointer gap technique**

Why important:

* Extremely common trick
* Teaches maintaining distance between pointers
* Builds interview confidence

---

🛑 **STOP CHECKPOINT**

If you:

* Can code all 5 without looking
* Can explain fast/slow math
* Can manipulate pointers without confusion

➡ You have covered 70% of Linked List interview patterns.

Then move to Phase 2.

---

# ⚡ Phase 2 — Interview-Level Mediums

These introduce pattern combinations.

---

### 6️⃣ 2. Add Two Numbers

Pattern: **Digit simulation + carry handling**

Why important:

* Tests edge cases
* Tests pointer iteration
* Common real interview question

---

### 7️⃣ 24. Swap Nodes in Pairs

Pattern: **Local pointer manipulation**

Why important:

* Tests fine pointer handling
* Builds confidence for harder rearrangements

---

### 8️⃣ 143. Reorder List

Pattern:

* Find middle (fast/slow)
* Reverse second half
* Merge alternately

Why important:

* Combination problem
* Extremely popular in interviews
* Pattern recognition booster

If you solve this cleanly → you are strong.

---

### 9️⃣ 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists

Pattern: **Pointer switching trick**

Why important:

* Elegant logic
* Tests reasoning ability
* Very interview friendly

---

🛑 SECOND STOP CHECKPOINT

You can now:

* Reverse
* Detect cycle
* Find middle
* Merge
* Handle carries
* Handle intersection
* Combine patterns

At this stage, you are INTERVIEW READY for Linked Lists.

Unless aiming for very strong companies, you can move forward.

---

# 🚀 Phase 3 — Stretch (Optional)

Only if targeting top-tier roles or want mastery.

---

### 🔟 25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group

Pattern: **Segment reversal**

Why important:

* Hard pointer control
* Advanced variation of 206

---

### 1️⃣1️⃣ 138. Copy List with Random Pointer

Pattern: **Hashing + structure cloning**

Why important:

* Deep understanding of structure
* Tests memory + mapping

---

These are high-skill problems.
Not mandatory for mid-level interviews.

---

# 🛑 EXACTLY WHEN TO STOP THIS CHAPTER

You STOP when:

* You can solve:

  * Reverse
  * Remove Nth
  * Reorder List
  * Detect Cycle
  * Merge Two Lists

Without notes.

AND

* You recognize instantly:

  * "Middle?" → Fast/slow
  * "From end?" → Gap technique
  * "Rearrange?" → Split + reverse + merge
  * "Cycle?" → Floyd

If recognition speed < 5 seconds → move on.

Do NOT chase perfection.

Breadth first. Depth later.

# 🔁 3 High-Quality Revision Problems (Non-Repetitive)

These test pattern mixing.

---

### ⭐ 234. Palindrome Linked List

Patterns:

* Find middle
* Reverse second half
* Compare

Why:

* Combines multiple basics
* Clean interview question

---

### ⭐ 61. Rotate List

Pattern:

* Length calculation
* Circular linking
* Break at right place

Why:

* Tests structural understanding

---

### ⭐ 82. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II

Pattern:

* Careful pointer skipping
* Dummy node usage

Why:

* Edge case heavy
* Interview realistic

---

# 🧠 Recognition Map (Memorize This)

Problem asks… → Think…

* Middle → Fast/Slow
* From end → Gap pointers
* Rearrange → Split + Reverse + Merge
* Cycle → Floyd
* Reverse part → Local pointer reversal
* Two lists → Merge logic

If you master this recognition tree, Linked List is DONE.

# 📊 Total Problems Count

Phase 1 → 5
Phase 2 → 4
Phase 3 → 2
Revision → 3

Core required: **9 problems**

Perfect size. No redundancy.
