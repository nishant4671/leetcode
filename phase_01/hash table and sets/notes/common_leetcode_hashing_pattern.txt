6️⃣ Common LeetCode Hashing Patterns
🔹 Pattern 1: First Unique Character

Problem:

"leetcode" → 'l'
"aabb" → -1


Idea:

Count frequency

Scan again

First char with freq == 1

freq = {}
for c in s:
    freq[c] = freq.get(c, 0) + 1

for i, c in enumerate(s):
    if freq[c] == 1:
        return i

🔹 Pattern 2: Pair Sum (Two Sum)

Problem:

nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9


Idea:

Store what you’ve seen

Check if target - x exists

seen = {}

for i, x in enumerate(nums):
    need = target - x
    if need in seen:
        return [seen[need], i]
    seen[x] = i


🧠 Mental model:

“Have I seen the missing piece before?”

🔹 Pattern 3: Anagrams

Problem:

"eat" & "tea" → True


Idea:

Same frequency = anagram

from collections import Counter

Counter(s) == Counter(t)


Or manually with a hashmap.

🔹 Pattern 4: Group Anagrams

Input:

["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]


Idea:

Use sorted word as key

groups = {}

for word in strs:
    key = "".join(sorted(word))
    groups.setdefault(key, []).append(word)


Output:

[['eat','tea','ate'], ['tan','nat'], ['bat']]
