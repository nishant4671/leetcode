Perfect. This is a **very important phase** in your DSA journey.

Since you already know:

* Time complexity
* Arrays
* Sliding window
* Two pointers
* Binary search
* Stack basics

Now we build **Hashing mastery for interviews**.

I’ll give you a **strict sequence**.
Do them in this exact order.

No skipping.

---

# 🔥 PHASE 1 — Foundations (Must Do First)

These build frequency + membership thinking.

---

### 1️⃣ **#217 – Contains Duplicate**

👉 Pure set problem
Pattern: Membership checking

---

### 2️⃣ **#242 – Valid Anagram**

👉 Frequency dictionary comparison
Pattern: Character counting

---

### 3️⃣ **#1 – Two Sum**

👉 Most important hashing problem ever
Pattern: Complement lookup

---

### 4️⃣ **#383 – Ransom Note**

👉 Frequency counting
Pattern: Decrement counts safely

---

### 5️⃣ **#169 – Majority Element**

👉 Frequency + observation
(Also teaches better O(1) solution later)

---

After these 5:
You understand basic hashing.

---

# 🔥 PHASE 2 — Core Interview Patterns

Now we increase thinking depth.

---

### 6️⃣ **#49 – Group Anagrams**

Pattern:

* Sorting as key
* OR character frequency as key

Very important pattern.

---

### 7️⃣ **#347 – Top K Frequent Elements**

Pattern:

* Frequency map
* Heap (later)
* Bucket sort idea

---

### 8️⃣ **#36 – Valid Sudoku**

Pattern:

* Multiple hash sets
* Row/Column/Box tracking

Tests clean logic.

---

### 9️⃣ **#128 – Longest Consecutive Sequence**

⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT

Pattern:

* Set usage
* Sequence start detection

Classic interview favorite.

---

# 🔥 PHASE 3 — Slightly Advanced Patterns

Now we combine hashing + prefix idea.

---

### 🔟 **#560 – Subarray Sum Equals K**

Pattern:

* Prefix sum + hashmap
  ⚠️ Extremely important.

---

### 1️⃣1️⃣ **#525 – Contiguous Array**

Similar pattern
Binary prefix trick.

---

### 1️⃣2️⃣ **#438 – Find All Anagrams in a String**

Pattern:

* Sliding window + frequency hashmap

Very interview heavy.

---

# 🔥 PHASE 4 — High Value Extras (If Time Allows)

---

### 1️⃣3️⃣ **#3 – Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**

(Hash + sliding window)

---

### 1️⃣4️⃣ **#380 – Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)**

Advanced hashing + design

---

### 1️⃣5️⃣ **#981 – Time Based Key-Value Store**

Hash + binary search

---

# 🎯 Final Ordered List (Clean Version)

Do exactly in this order:

```
217
242
1
383
169
49
347
36
128
560
525
438
3
380
981
```

---

# 🧠 Important Strategy

For each problem:

1. First try brute force
2. Then ask:

   * Can I use a set?
   * Can I store complement?
   * Can I use frequency map?
   * Can I convert this to prefix sum?

---

# ⚡ If You Want Real Interview Readiness

After finishing above:

Redo these without looking:

* 1
* 49
* 128
* 560

If you can solve them from memory → You’re strong.

Now tell me:

Which one are you currently solving?
I will guide you thinking-wise (not give solution directly). 🔥
