I am currently studying: [CHAPTER NAME]

My current level:
- Topics I have completed: [list them]
- Topics I struggle with: [if any]
- I can solve Easy / Medium / Hard (mention honestly)

I want:

1) A strict LeetCode problem sequence (with problem numbers)
2) Divided into phases (Foundation → Core → Advanced)
3) Tell me which problems are MUST-DO for interviews
4) Mention what pattern each problem teaches
5) Tell me when I should move to next chapter
6) Give me 3 revision problems at the end

Important:
- Do NOT overload me
- Keep it optimal for FAANG-level interviews
- Sequence must be logical
- No random list dumping
